Hi, I'm Simon Joel Warkentin.
<br>
Working in sales is my day job, but my heart finds its rhythm in a few other corners of the world too. My past has led me through the lanes of 5 countries, each teaching me a bit more about life and gifting me with languages I now cherish. Yet, no matter where I've been, I always see myself as a student, eager to understand and learn.
<br>
Tech, especially Linux, has been a recent journey for me. I’m far from an expert, but every day brings new challenges and lessons. And music? It's a passion I've held close. While I might have the look of a metalhead, my musical tastes span from the classics to jazz and beyond.
<br>
Travel and nature have been my silent teachers. They've shown me the beauty in simplicity and the importance of staying grounded. On the digital front, I’ve been slowly distancing myself from mainstream social media platforms, finding solace in the quieter pockets of the internet.
<br>
I'm a believer in the power of community and collaboration, which is why I've grown fond of Free and Open Source Software. There's something special about people coming together to create and share openly.
<br>
If you ever want to chat about tech, music, or just life in general, don’t hesitate to reach out. My inbox is always open at [your-email@example.com] and you can catch me on Whatsapp/Signal at [+1234567890]. I'm always grateful for new connections and shared stories.
