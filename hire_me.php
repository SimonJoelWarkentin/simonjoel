		Hey, I'm Simon Joel Warkentin.
		<br>My journey has taken me through 5 countries, and along the way, I've picked up 4 languages.
		<br>Beyond the world of tech and Linux, I often lose myself in creating music or exploring new places.
		<br>With a deep appreciation for Free and Open Source Software, I'm always learning and evolving.
