Hello!

I stumbled upon the IT Support job at [Company's Name] on LinkedIn and got really excited. I've spent a good part of my last few years working in customer service related jobs at Teleperformance and Telus International. I started in customer support, got into some other roles like Accont Executive, but what I really love and want to work with is technology.

I'm a self-taught tech enthusiast with a love for Linux and a knack for solving problems. Though I don't have any corporate experience in IT, I’ve spent a lot of hours learning Linux and other technologies, including programming and scripting languages like Bash, PHP, and a bit of Python and JavaScript. My dream is to be a Linux System Administrator someday, and this role feels like a solid step on that path.

I’m keen on bringing my customer success skills to the IT Support team at [Company's Name], and learn more about the IT world. I’d love to talk more about how I can fit into your team. You can reach me on whatsapp at +351 927564122 (yes, it is a portuguese number) or onmy email mail@simonjoel.com. Also, feel free to check out my website <a href="https://simonjoel.com">simonjoel.com</a>.

Thank you very much for considering me. I am looking forward to hopefully working together!

Best Regards,
Simon Joel
