Hello!

I stumbled upon the Technical Support Associate job at AnyDesk on LinkedIn and got really excited. I've spent a good part of my last few years working in customer service related jobs at Teleperformance and Telus International. I started in customer support, got into some other roles like Accont Executive, but what I really love and want to work with is technology.

I'm a self-taught tech enthusiast with a love for Linux and i think i am generally a good problem solver. Though I don't have any corporate experience in IT, I’ve spent a lot of hours learning Linux and other technologies.

I’m keen on bringing my customer success skills to the AnyDesk Support teem, and learn more about the IT world. I’d love to talk more about how I can fit into your team. You can reach me on whatsapp at +351 927564122 (yes, it is a portuguese number) or on my email mail@simonjoel.com. Also, feel free to check out my website <a href="https://simonjoel.com">simonjoel.com</a>.

Thank you very much for considering me. I am looking forward to hopefully working together!

Best Regards,
Simon Joel
