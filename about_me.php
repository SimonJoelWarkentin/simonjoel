            <h2>Hi, I am Simon Joel</h2>
	    <p>
My full name is Simon Joel Warkentin, some close friends call me Joel.
<br><br>
Working in sales is my day job, but my heart finds itself in a few other corners of the world too.
<br>
My past has led me through the lanes of 5 countries, each teaching me a bit more about life and gifting me with languages I now cherish.
<br>
Yet, no matter where I've been, I always see myself as a student, eager to understand and learn.
<br><br>
Tech, especially Linux, has been a recent journey for me. I‚Äôm far from an expert, but every day brings new challenges and lessons.
<br>
And music? It's a passion I've held close. While I certainly do have the look of a metalhead, my musical taste is not at all limited.
<br>
Besides Metal, i also listen to (and play) Jazz, classical music, progressive rock and more!
<br><br>
Travel and nature have been my silent teachers. They've shown me the beauty in simplicity and the importance of staying grounded.
<br>
On the digital front, I‚Äôve been slowly distancing myself from mainstream social media platforms, finding solace in the quieter pockets of the internet.
<br><br>
I'm a believer in the power of community and collaboration, which is why I've grown fond of Free and Open Source Software.
<br>
There's something special about people coming together to create and share openly.
<br><br>
If you ever want to chat about tech, music, or just life in general, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out. My inbox is always open at mail@simonjoel.com.
<br>
I'm always grateful for new connections and shared stories.

		Hey, I'm Simon Joel Warkentin.
