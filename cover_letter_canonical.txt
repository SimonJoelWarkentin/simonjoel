Hello!

I stumbled upon the Linux Desktop Support Engineer job at Canonical on LinkedIn and got really excited. I've spent a good part of my last few years working in customer service related jobs at Teleperformance and Telus International. I started in customer support, got into some other roles like Accont Executive, but what I really love and want to work with is technology, especially related to Free and Open Source Software.

I'm a self-taught tech enthusiast with a love for Linux and i think i am generally a good problem solver. Though I don't have any corporate experience in IT, I’ve spent a lot of hours learning Linux and other technologies. My dream is to be a Linux System Administrator someday, and this role feels like a solid step in the right direction.

Canonical has been on my radar for a long time because I use Ubuntu myself. And as i realize that i don't have the technical skills to be a sysadmin or something similar (yet), i would be pleased to work in a Linux Desktop Support Engineer role at Canonical.

I’m keen on bringing my customer success skills to the Canonical Linux Desktop Support teem, and learn more about the IT world. I’d love to talk more about how I can fit into your team. You can reach me on whatsapp at +351 927564122 (yes, it is a portuguese number) or on my email mail@simonjoel.com. Also, feel free to check out my website <a href="https://simonjoel.com">simonjoel.com</a> (it runs on an Ubuntu server, of course).

Thank you very much for considering me. I am looking forward to hopefully working together!

Best Regards,
Simon Joel
